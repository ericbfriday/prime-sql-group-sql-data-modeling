# Week4: SQL Data Modeling (group project)

### Data Modeling Group Challenge
#### Objectives
Practice taking a problem statement or a client request and modeling your database schema to fit the needs of the problem. This will become useful quickly for solo projects and group projects.

#### Tools
- A diagraming tool. There are several options.

	- [https://www.gliffy.com/](https://www.gliffy.com/)
	- [https://www.lucidchart.com/](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
	- A white board is a great tool too.
- psql shell or Postico to test the create table syntax you come up with.

#### Client Statement
For the joins lecture tomorrow we need to design a database to help Prime start to model their staff data. We have three entities in this system departments, staff members, and lectures. The departments at prime are Instruction, Administration, and the new Culinary department. A staff member can be in multiple departments, for ex. Scott is in both Instruction and Administration. Lectures are owned by one staff member to maintain them and keep them up to date between cohorts. A staff member may have multiple lectures they maintain.

Draw an entity relational diagram and write the create table syntax to define the tables needed to model this system.
